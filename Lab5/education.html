        <h2> P.E.S Institute of Technology </h2>
        
        <p> 
        
          My favorite course was Algorithms. I cannot put my finger on why it was so, but that was the only class i didn't fall asleep in.

          <h3> A memorable memory </h3>
          
          <p>
          
            A memorable memory would be when a professor flipped the script and said he liked the last benchers more than the front bench nerds.

        <h2> B.G.S International Residential School </h2>
        
        <p> 
        
          My favorite course was introduction to C++ lab, not because the teacher was great or the subject was interesting. It was simply because the whole class played counter strike on lan during this class.

          <h3> A memorable memory </h3>
          
          <p>
          
            A memorable memory would be when i jumped out of the class window (just a few meters higher than ground level) unseen but when a friend tried to follow, got caught and had to listen to an earfull from the principal.
